# Karsten's BIG-TOE

Copyright (C) 1970-2025 Karsten Graham Wade

This document is a table of open papers with an overview and general description of Karsten Wade's Big, Inclusive, and General Theory Of Everything (BIG-TOE).

When you stumble across something like Karsten's BIG-TOE, you might think it will be a comprehensive and complete theory of everything. Of course it's not, that would be silly. What an ego I would have, if I thought I had a complete TOE! Oh, no, definitely not — my BIG-TOE is the label and the thought-container I apply to the many, small, partially-complete theories I have gathered and accumulated across the mindscape over the years.
